# HAMMOCK - peptide clustering
Hammock is a software tool to cluster peptide sequences on the basis of shared sequence motifs. It can process very large datasets of up to a million unique sequences. The main motivation are data from phage display experiments sequenced using NGS, but no limits are put on the origin of input data - Hammock will cluster any set of peptide sequences.
